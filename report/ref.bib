  abstract = {The radiation environment in free space and the related radiation exposure is seen as one of the main health detriments for future long-duration human exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The steady flux of energetic particles in the galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) produces a low dose-rate radiation exposure, which is heavily influenced by several factors including the solar cycle, the presence of an atmosphere, relevant magnetic fields (as on Earth) and of course by the relevant spacecraft shielding. Investigations of the GCR variations over the course of a solar cycle provide valuable data for exploration mission planning and for the determination of the radiation load received due to the GCR environment. Within the current work these investigations have been performed applying three datasets generated on board the International Space Station (ISS) with the DOSTEL instruments in the frame of the DOSIS and DOSIS-3D projects, with the CRaTER instrument in a Moon orbit and with the MSL-RAD instrument on the way to and on the surface of Mars. To derive GCR dose contributions on board the ISS two procedures have been developed separating the contributions from GCR from passing’s through the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), as well as ways to extrapolate the GCR dose measured on board the ISS to free space based on various ranges of the McIlwain \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}-shell parameter. At the end we provide a dataset spanning the timeframe for GCR measurements on the ISS (2009–2011 \& 2012–2019), Moon (2009–2019) and Mars (2012–2019), thereby covering the time span from the deep minimum of solar cycle 23, the ascending phase and maximum of solar cycle 24, and the descending phase of cycle 24, which is ongoing at the time of this writing.}},

  abstract = {Single-junction flat-plate terrestrial solar cells are fundamentally limited to about 30\% solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency, but multiple junctions and concentrated light make much higher efficiencies practically achievable. Until now, four-junction III–V concentrator solar cells have demonstrated the highest solar conversion efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate 47.1\% solar conversion efficiency using a monolithic, series-connected, six-junction inverted metamorphic structure operated under the direct spectrum at 143\,Suns concentration. When tuned to the global spectrum, a variation of this structure achieves a 1-Sun global efficiency of 39.2\%. Nearly optimal bandgaps for six junctions were fabricated using alloys of III–V semiconductors. To develop these junctions, it was necessary to minimize threading dislocations in lattice-mismatched III–V alloys, prevent phase segregation in metastable quaternary III–V alloys and understand dopant diffusion in complex structures. Further reduction of the series resistance within this structure could realistically enable efficiencies over 50\%.},

The author explains how to predict the reliability and the longevity of the packages based on leak rate measurements and the assumptions of impurities. Non-specialists in particular will benefit from the author's long involvement in the technology. Hermeticity is a subject that demands practical experience, and solving one problem does not necessarily give one the background to solve another. Thus, the book provides a ready reference to help deal with day to day issues as they arise. The book gathers in a single volume a great many issues previously available only in journals̮or only in the experience of working engineers. How to define the "goodness" of a seal? How is that seal measured? How does the integrity of the seal affect circuit reliability? What is the significance of the measured integrity of the seal? What is the relationship of Residual Gas Analysis and the seal integrity? The handbook answers these questions and more, providing an analysis of nearly 100 problems representative of the wide variety of challenges that actually occur in industry today."--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Next to the qualitative determination of the chemical composition of a plasma from emission and absorption line identifications, the measurement of electron and ion or atom temperatures is the oldest application of spectroscopic methods to plasma and gaseous electrical discharge physics, not to mention astronomy. It continues to play an important role, e.g., in fusion research (DeMichelis and Mattioli 1981, 1984 and Kauffman 1991). In the laboratory, independent methods based on laser light scattering and Langmuir probes are available, as already mentioned in the introduction to the preceding chapter. However, in astronomy spectroscopic methods normally must stand alone. Another important distinction is the usually dominant role of radiative transfer (see chapter 8) in astronomical applications, compared with the relatively small optical depth in some useful portion of the spectrum of most laboratory plasmas.In many cases, it is necessary to distinguish between kinetic temperatures of electrons, ions and atoms, say, Te, Tz, and Ta. These temperatures may differ from each other even if the individual velocity distributions are close to Maxwellians, because, e.g., electron-electron energy transfer rates are much larger than electron-ion collision rates, as are ion-ion rates (Spitzer 1962). In most applications, at least the electrons do have a Maxwellian distribution, and we will assume this here.},

  abstract = {For solar cells operating under the broad-band solar spectrum, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency is fundamentally limited by transmission and thermalization losses. For monochromatic light, these losses can be minimized by matching the photon energy and the absorber material's bandgap energy. Furthermore, for high-crystal-quality direct semiconductors, radiative recombination dominates the minority carrier recombination. Light-trapping schemes can leverage reabsorption of thereby internally generated photons. Such photon recycling increases the effective excess carrier concentration, which, in turn, increases photovoltage and consequently conversion efficiency. Herein, a back surface reflector underneath a GaAs/AlGaAs rear-heterojunction structure leverages photon recycling to effectively reduce radiative recombination losses and therefore boost the photovoltage. At the same time, resonance in the created optical cavity is tailored to enhance near-bandgap absorption and, thus, minimize thermalization loss. With a thin film process and a combined dielectric–metal reflector, an unprecedented photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 68.9 ± 2.8\% under 858 nm monochromatic light at an irradiance of 11.4 W cm−2 is demonstrated.},

All such scenarios involve transmission through atmosphere and beam perturbations due to turbulence that must be quantified. Numerical beam propagation and feedback control simulations were performed using an algorithm optimized for efficient calculation of real-time beam dynamics in a Kolmogorov atmosphere. Results were used to quantify the effectiveness of the system design with different degrees of atmospheric turbulence and zenith angles, and it was found that a large aperture DEPA system placed at a high altitude site can produce a stable diffraction limited spot (Strehl\&gt;0.8) on space-based targets for Fried length r0≥10cm (at 500 nm) and zenith angles up to 60 deg, depending on atmospheric conditions. We believe these results are promising for the next generation of power beaming and deep space exploration applications.},

Such fluctuation would be inevitable due to nonuniformity of the atmosphere conditions and other reasons. In this study fundamental study on the LSP oscillation was carried out since it is expected that the thruster performance will be improved by the suppression of the oscillation. A model of the plasma oscillation was proposed, and its validity was evaluated from comparison with the experimental results. According to the model, it was shown that the oscillation would be suppressed by using the lens of small focusing length. The experimental results support this idea.},

  abstract = {At the Space Engineering (SpE) department of the Delft University of Technology performance testing of micropropulsion systems is done using the Delft Aerospace Rocket Thrust Stand (DARTS) facility. The DARTS facility has a need for a new improved test stand which can measure the thrust performance of the in-house developed micro-thrusters. The work presented in this Master thesis report addresses this need. This report shows the validation process of a test stand capable of steady-state thrust measurements in a range of 0.1 to 15[mN]. The AE-TB-5m thrust bench is selected to provide these measurement capabilities. The AE-TB-5m test stand has been re-assembled, improved and discrepancies in its measurement characteristics have been successfully identified and solved. A new calibration process for the test stand has been developed to provide full automation in order to mitigate any inconsistencies due to human influence. Furthermore, the measurement accuracies are determined and are found to be below 0.036[mN], which fully complies with the target requirement of 0.1[mN]. The test stand measurement capabilities have been successfully demonstrated in both an atmospheric and vacuum environment using the heritage T3 Micro Propulsion System (T3μPS) thruster test model originating from the Delfi-n3Xt CubeSat mission. Moreover, an empirical relation for the estimation of a loss factor on the thrust coefficient due to viscous effects in low Reynolds number nozzles has been evaluated. The results of this analysis shows improved correlation with experimental data in vacuum conditions and for Reynolds numbers between 5500 and 10000 when compared with ideal rocket theory. The feasibility of an experimental bell-shaped micro nozzle produced using a novel microprecision additive manufacturing technique has been evaluated. The nozzle shape showed a nearly perfect correlation between the designed bell curve and the manufactured product. An axially symmetric bell nozzle of this micron scale is considered a unique engineering accomplishment. The nozzle throat shows incompatibility with a high vacuum environment resulting from inspection with an electron-microscope. Despite a collapsed throat, a leak path trough the throat is successfully identified using the AE-TB-5m, again demonstrating its operational capabilities. The test stand is considered fully operational and ready to enable thrust measurements of other micropropulsion systems at the DARTS facility.},

  abstract = {Laser thermal propulsion refers to a concept in which power from a laser is beamed to a vehicle, where it is absorbed and used to heat a propellent gas that produces thrust at high values of specific impulse. The success of the concept depends upon the ability to create laser sustained plasmas that are stable in the presence of a forced convection flow and that absorb essentially all of the incident laser radiation. In addition, the thermal radiation losses from the plasma must be controlled to realize high performance without the penalty of thermal radiators. Extensive experiments have been performed and analyzed utilizing plasmas sustained in flowing argon by a carbon dioxide laser of less than 1 kW incident power. Spatially detailed measurements of the temperature in the plasmas have resulted in a detailed understanding of the energy conversion processes occurring within the plasma. This understanding has provided an explanation of the limited range of pressure and power observed for stable operation of laser sustained plasmas and suggests the means by which that range can be extended. A computational model based on a Navier-Stokes description of the flow has been developed which utilizes ray tracing for the optical interaction and temperature dependent transport and thermodynamic properties for the plasma. This model has been verified using the detailed experimental results for the argon plasmas and has been extended to provide predictions for higher laser powers in hydrogen.},

Specific impulses in excess of 1000 seconds are achievable because propellant temperatures are very high and low molecular weight gases can be used. This report focuses on the energy conversion mechanisms of laser-sustained plasmas in flowing argon. The status of AFOSR sponsored experiments to determine thermal efficiency and global absorption is detailed. An improved testing facility has allowed plasma operating conditions never before possible. The results indicate that nearly all of the input laser power can be absorbed by a plasma. Plasmas at elevated gas pressure have been tested, and preliminary results presented. Optimal operating conditions have yet to be determined for the available laser powers and gas pressures. Further experimentation at very high argon gas velocities  20 ms must be performed in order to completely characterize plasma behavior. Keywords Beamed energy propulsion, Laser plasma formation.},

  abstract = {The format and size specifications of the CubeSat platform require highly miniaturized subsystems, one of the most challenging ones being the propulsion system. Up to date, according to the authors' knowledge, only two CubeSats have successfully operated a propulsion system in space: CanX-2 in 2008 and Defil-n3Xt in 2013. The importance of a miniaturized propulsion system becomes even more apparent when taken into consideration that most, if not all, of the CubeSats launched to date, due to budget constraints, have been piggybacking their launches into space and therefore they may end up in a non-optimal orbit. As a next step, a formation flying technology demonstration mission is planned by the Delft University of Technology (DelFFi), as part of the QB50 project. This thesis gives an outline of the present development status of micro-propulsion systems at Delft University of Technology. The main design driving criteria are provided by the DelFFi satellites requirements. Keeping in mind the educational environment in which the work is performed, safety drives the requirements: thus, propellants have to be non-toxic and easy to handle. Additionally, present requirements aim at a thrust level in the range of 1 to 10 [mN] and a total ?V of 15 [m/s] or more. Wet mass, when installed in triple-unit CubeSats, shall be less than 450 [g], and peak power consumption less than 10 [W]. A number of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems have been investigated to find suitable candidates that fulfil these minimum requirements. However, it has been concluded that all presently available systems have low Technology-Readiness-Level (TRL) or their performance is out of the required range. It was thus necessary to start working at custom designed system. The design process and decisions made will be presented in this thesis. Furthermore for testing purposes also a test setup and an engineering model propulsion system was made. A general test program using LabVIEW was made that can automate the testing process of the thruster.

  abstract = {Large scale directed energy offers the possibility of radical transformation in a variety of areas, including the ability to achieve relativistic flight that will enable the first interstellar missions as well as rapid interplanetary transit. In addition, the same technology opens a wide mission space that allows a diverse range of options from long range beamed power to remote spacecraft and outposts to planetary defense to remote composition analysis and manipulation of asteroids, among others. Directed energy relies on photonics, which like electronics is an exponentially expanding growth area driven by diverse economic interests that allows transformational advances in space exploration and capability. In order to begin to fully exploit this capability it is important to understand not only the possibilities enabled by it, but also the technological challenges involved and to have a logical roadmap to exploit this option. This capability is both synergistic with conventional propulsion and offers a road to a future currently not possible with conventional capabilities.}

  abstract = {In the nearly 60 years of spaceflight we have accomplished wonderful feats of exploration that have shown the incredible spirit of the human drive to explore and understand our universe. Yet in those 60 years we have barely left our solar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally leaving the solar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006\% the speed of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the nearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream of human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it is not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we should choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it is within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer ("wafersats") that reach more than \$1/4c\$ and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft with masses more than \$10\^5\$ kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications, imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed energy propulsion.},

The effects of argon gas pressure, laser power, and N2 mixture ratio, on the full-view of radiation spectra and electron parameters, were investigated experimentally. The results demonstrate that the increase of gas pressure or laser power density is a proper way to achieve higher optical radiation from the argon LSP, but not by adding molecular mixtures like N2.},

  abstract = {Laser-sustained plasma (LSP) is a promising method for high-pressure plasma generation that overcomes the problems of arc discharge. Then, the generating conditions of argon LSP were investigated using a kilowatt class disk, fiber and diode lasers. For the disk and fiber lasers, the threshold laser power for LSP generation was found to decrease with pressure. The minimum laser power of the disk and fiber lasers was 1.1\,kW\,at a pressure of 1.5\,MPa and 0.45\,kW\,at a pressure of 2.0\,MPa. The threshold power of the disk laser was higher than that of the fiber laser. The fiber laser might have a lower threshold because atomic line absorption occurs at 1067\,nm and 1068\,nm since both absorption coefficients achieved through the Bremsstrahlung process are almost the same. Since LSP could not be generated by a diode laser at a pressure of less than 6.5\,MPa, the generating conditions were estimated based on the product of the absorption coefficient of laser intensity. A pressure of more than 8\,MPa was found to be necessary for a laser with 1\,kW of power, and laser power of more than 109\,kW is necessary for a pressure of 0.1\,MPa.},

Since the Boltzmann plot method requires local thermal equilibrium (LTE), the parameter regions of electron temperature and electron density, in which the Boltzmann plot method is applicable, were analyzed in terms of a comparison of the spontaneous emission and collisional excitation to the excited states. It is observed that in our rf-inductive plasma near the atmospheric pressure range the Boltzmann plot method does not provide an exact measurement of electron temperature because of relatively low electron density, which does not satisfy the calculation criteria. An alternative method employing a combination of the Stark broadening measurement and the Saha-Boltzmann equation was demonstrated to more accurately determine the plasma parameters (electron temperature and electron density).},

  abstract = {The present paper embodies an attempt towards a physical explanation of the ordered gradation in the spectra of stars—a subject in which pioneering work was done by the late Sir Norman Lockyer, but which was worked up with systematic thoroughness at the Harvard College Observatory, under the lead of the late Prof. E. C. Pickering and Miss A. J. Cannon. During this interval the spectra of more than 100,000 stars have been photographed, classified, and published with full details in the Henry Draper Memorial Catalogue. The most noteworthy facts which have been brought to light from these monumental studies have thus been summarised by H. N. Russell. "The spectra of the stars show remarkably few radical differences in type. More than 99 per cent. of them fall into one or the other of the six great groups which during the classic work of the Harvard College Observatory were recognised as of fundamental importance, and received as designations, by the process of the survival of the fittest, the rather arbitrary letters B, A, F, G, K, M. That there should be so few types is noteworthy, but much more remarkable is the fact that they form a continuous series. Every degree of gradation between the typical spectra denoted by B and A may be found in different stars, and the same is true to the end of the series, a fact recognised in the familiar decimal classification, in which B5A, for example, denotes a spectrum half-way between the typical examples B and A. The series is not merely continuous, it is linear. There exists slight difference between the spectra of different stars of the same spectral class, such as Ao, but these relate to minor details. Almost all the stars of the small outstanding minority fall into three other classes (or rather four), denoted by the letters P, O, N, R. Of these, O undoubtedly precedes B at the head of the series, while R and N, which grade one into the other, come probably at its other end, though in this case the transition stages are not clearly worked out.”},

Breakthrough improvements may be possible with electric propulsion powered by directed energy, where a large-aperture laser phased array directs energy to photovoltaics on electric propulsion vehicles. Narrowband intensity gain over sunlight would lower onboard power system specific mass (kg/kW) to enable fast Solar System missions without advanced nuclear or exotic power and propulsion systems. The proposed architecture is modular and offers scalability from nanosatellites to human missions, with opportunities for operational systems and Solar System exploration along a technology development roadmap.},

  abstract = {Active development of electric thrustors began 10 years ago. Today, several kinds of thrustors have achieved efficiencies above 90 \% and lifetimes of several thousand hours. The following article derives the basic theory of electric thrust production at constant exhaust velocity, and at variable exhaust velocity programmed for optimum vehicle performance. Electrothermal or arcjet; electrostatic or ion; and electrodynamic or plasma thrustors are described. At the present time, ion thrustors of the electron bombardment and of the surface ionization types are the most promising systems. Electric power in space may be generated by solar cells or nuclear-electric generators. It is expected that the incore thermionic converter will eventually be the preferred system. A variety of missions with electric propulsion systems appear feasible and highly desirable, among them orbital station keeping, attitude control, planetary probes, solar and out-of-the-ecliptic probes, deep-space probes, and manned Mars and Venus exploration. For each mission, a careful systems-design study must be made, which will provide the optimum selection of thrustor type, thrust level, exhaust velocity, thrust program, power source, trajectory, and flight plan.},

  abstract = {Miniaturization in spacecraft is an ongoing process in which the launched satellites become smaller and smaller. This trend introduces issues, such as the choice for a reliable and efficient propulsion subsystem. The implementation of engines would enable the spacecraft to perform maneuvers such as orbit changes, drag compensation and attitude control. Solar Thermal Propulsion (STP) has been identified as a promising candidate, due to its theoretical specific impulse being well above that of the best chemical thrusters when hydrogen is the propellant of choice. The concept has never been flown in space but would benefit from ground demonstrations proving that the potential can be realized. This work will focus on demonstrating the STP performance. The goal was set to reach a Sea Level (SL) specific impulse of 90.0 s at a continuous mass flow of 300 mg s−1 and input power of 250 W. During the project, a demonstration thruster named Solar Thermal Thruster 2 was designed. The resulting engine consisted of a copper heat exchanger and nozzle with a highpowered laser as the irradiation source of choice. Concurrently, a Preliminary Design Tool was developed to assess the performance of STP engines. Verification and validation was done by comparing the tool outputs to other theoretical and experimental results. Verification was completed, but for validation STT2 experimental results were required. Preliminary test results of STT2 showed that the motor had some shortcomings, due to concessions made. Erroneously, its heat exchanger had been built with a reduced number of channels, rendering the thruster unavailable for testing. Next to that, the engine suffered from leakages. For further validation of the tool, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed. The thermal part of the tool was validated, but the pressure loss results deviated too much. As such, further experiments are required in this area. In the end, an updated design (STT3) was made of the thruster. The number of channels in the heat exchanger was increased and its mass and area was reduced. It proved to have an SL specific impulse of 84.9 s, almost meeting the goal set for the thesis. It is recommended that the engine is built and tested at Delft University of Technology (DUT) in order to complete validation of the tool and demonstrate the feasibility of STP.},

The 1D3V simulations modeled an electron cascade across an argon-filled capacitor, including electron-neutral ionization, electron-neutral elastic collisions, electron-neutral excitation, and ion-induced secondary electron emission. In electrical breakdown, the timescale difference between ion and electron motion makes traditional PIC methods computationally slow. To decrease this timescale difference and speed up computation, we used SLPIC, a time-domain algorithm that limits the speed of the fastest electrons in the simulation. The SLPIC algorithm facilitates a straightforward, fully kinetic treatment of dynamics and collisions. SLPIC was as accurate as PIC, but ran up to 200 times faster. SLPIC accurately computed the Paschen curve for argon over three orders of magnitude in pressure.},

  abstract = {A thrust stand is developed for measuring the pulsed thrust generated by low-thrust liquid pulsed rocket engines. It mainly consists of a thrust dynamometer, a base frame, a connecting frame, and a data acquisition and processing system. The thrust dynamometer assembled with shear mode piezoelectric quartz sensors is developed as the core component of the thrust stand. It adopts integral shell structure. The sensors are inserted into unique double-elastic-half-ring grooves with an interference fit. The thrust is transferred to the sensors by means of static friction forces of fitting surfaces. The sensors could produce an amount of charges which are proportional to the thrust to be measured. The thrust stand is calibrated both statically and dynamically. The in situ static calibration is performed using a standard force sensor. The dynamic calibration is carried out using pendulum-typed steel ball impact technique. Typical thrust pulse is simulated by a trapezoidal impulse force. The results show that the thrust stand has a sensitivity of 25.832 mV/N, a linearity error of 0.24\% FSO, and a repeatability error of 0.23\% FSO. The first natural frequency of the thrust stand is 1245 Hz. The thrust stand can accurately measure thrust waveform of each firing, which is used for fine control of on-orbit vehicles in the thrust range of 5–20 N with pulse frequency of 50 Hz.},

  abstract = {The development of highly integrated and compact micro-satellites and the need for a higher precision of positioning and attitude control in space missions has stimulated the development of micro-propulsion systems. At TU-Delft, investigations are focusing on non-chemical, thermal propulsion. TU-Delft is also collaborating with TNO and UTwente to develop a mini-propulsion system (T3-?ps) to be flown in 2011 as part of the MicroNed Nanosatellite Program. To complement these developments, the TU-Delft is developing test facilities and equipment for on ground testing of such systems. The most critical need is the ability to take thrust and impulse bit measurements with adequate accuracy and resolution. To this purpose, the TU-Delft has developed a thrust stand capable of measuring thrust levels in the range 100-1000mN and minimum impulse bit of 5mNs as well as a smaller stand capable of measuring thrusts ranging from 0.5-50mN and a minimum impulse bit of 0.05mNs. In collaboration with Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, we are currently investigating the development of a thrust stand capable of measuring thrust levels in the range 10-2000?N with an accuracy of ± 2?N and minimum impulse bit of 0.25?Ns. In addition, for thruster testing under rough vacuum conditions, a Heraeus vacutherm oven has been successfully adapted. This paper describes the test facility developments made at the TU-Delft as part of the MicroNed program. We will describe the design objectives, and the design methods used, provide an outline of the thrust stands and the vacuum facility and talk about their development status and how well they perform. Also test results will be presented to show the performances of the various thrust stands and the benefits of testing under rough vacuum conditions.},
