%     This report documents the work done during my three month internship at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). This project stems from a collaboration between McGill University and the PPPL, following the publication of \citetitle*{duplay_design_2022}, a mission design paper I worked on while finishing my undergraduate studies at McGill. This opportunity to collaborate arose about a month before the start of the summer, as I was still struggling to find an internship, so I would like to thank my former supervisor Andrew Higgins for arranging this experience. I would also like to thank Zhuofan Bao and Paria Makaremi-Esfarjani for their assistance with parts of this project. Finally, thanks to Ahmed Diallo, my supervisor at the PPPL, for inviting me to the PPPL and being a wonderful host.
