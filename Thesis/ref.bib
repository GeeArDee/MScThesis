  abstract = {A laser-sustained plasma (LSP) generator capable of operating as a laser-thermal thruster was designed and tested. The apparatus was powered by a 3-kW 1070-nm fiber-optic laser and was operated with argon gas. The laser absorption, radiated spectrum, and change in static pressure were recorded, and high-speed video footage of the LSP was acquired. Of special interest is the heat-deposition efficiency into the working gas resulting from LSP ignition, which was estimated by tracking the pressure change in the test section. Laser transmission through the plasma was also measured to quantify two energy loss mechanisms: incomplete laser absorption and radiation of heat to the walls of the test section. Minimizing these losses would be critical in the realization of a practical and efficient laser-thermal propulsion (LTP) thruster, as most of the laser energy should be deposited as heat in the propellant to maximize thruster specific impulse.},

  abstract = {Due to the material limitations of nuclear thermal rockets having solid cores, the maximum practical specific impulse achievable by these engines is in the range of 900s. To achieve significantly higher specific impulses, much higher propellant temperatures will be required, thus necessitating a radically different nuclear core design. One method which has been considered in the past to achieve these higher specific impulses is to use a nuclear pulse system. In this concept, a space vehicle is propelled forward by riding the series of blast waves that result from a succession of properly timed external nuclear explosions. This concept was actually tested in the 1960s under the project name Orion, using chemical rather than nuclear explosives. Another method of achieving higher specific impulses is to employ a gaseous fissioning core so as to eliminate the problem of fuel melting at extremely high temperatures. As might be expected, a number of significant design challenges exist with this concept primarily with regard to designing a feasible means of transferring heat from the gaseous fissioning core to the gaseous propellant.},

So, the LSP is a promising heat source of electrothermal type thruster, which has a higher specific impulse and longer lifetime than those of arcjet thrusters. In this study, we tried to generate methane, methane–argon and methane–xenon LSPs using 1 kW class diode laser. As a result, the LSP could not be generated for the methane and methane–argon gases though the emission intensity increased with the laser irradiation. In the case of methane–xenon gases, the LSP could be generated at the xenon pressure of 0.10 MPa, and the methane pressure ranged from 0.02 MPa to 0.06 MPa. The threshold power was around 850 W, which is lower than the pure xenon condition.},

In this work, an argon LSP was generated at high pressures ({$>$}10 bar) by a focused laser beam, and its fundamental properties were studied in detail by the approach of optical emission spectroscopy (OES), with emphasis on the determination of plasma parameters including the electron temperature and density. The effects of argon gas pressure, laser power, and N2 mixture ratio, on the full-view of radiation spectra and electron parameters, were investigated experimentally. The results demonstrate that the increase of gas pressure or laser power density is a proper way to achieve higher optical radiation from the argon LSP, but not by adding molecular mixtures like N2.},
