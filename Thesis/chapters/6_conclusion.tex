    \section{Summary}

        % Say how I answered the research objectives here

        This thesis lays the groundwork for future thrust tests with longer plasma lifetimes and better thrust measurement. Which would show thrust.

    \section{Future Work}

        % make complete sentences and em dashes for itemization, NOT bullet points
        Near term:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measure mass flow rate $\dot m$ of thruster with bubble flow meter
            \item Design a new thrust stand for more repeatable measurements (ex: a rotating arm thrust stand)
            \item Model the LSP in CFD [?]
            \item Implement spectroscopic measurements to determine temperature of plasma in our setup
        \end{itemize}

        Long term, to ultimately test is LTP is a viable means of space propulsion:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use a more powerful laser. Instead of 300 W CW, use 3kW CW.
            \item Move to hydrogen as a propellant
            \item Complete thrust tests in vacuum
        \end{itemize}

        %(be sure to talk about these in text before, where these would be improvements and why)
