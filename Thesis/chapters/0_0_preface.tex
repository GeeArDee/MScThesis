    First, I want to thank my supervisor, Professor Andrew J. Higgins, for his deep knowledge, mentorship and support throughout this journey. I also want to thank him for giving me, and the lab, the singular opportunity to pursue graduate studies on advanced space propulsion. In Canada, this is a rare topic of research indeed, but it is only with advances in this field that humanity will be able to reach the stars.

    I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the members of the McGill Interstellar Flight Experimental Research Group. Emmanuel and Siera, in the pursuit of science together, you have given me dear memories that will last a lifetime. I wish Siera much success in continuing the work Emmanuel and I have but started.

    Sebastian helped manufacture the V2 electrodes. Thank you for your knowledge on how to do things in the lab.

    Editorial help was provided by Emmanuel Duplay, Siera Riel, John Kokkalis, Sebastian Rodriguez, and Dan-Cornelius Savu.
    
    Thank you to my parents, who have always encouraged me in my studies. My thanks to Anna, for always listening to my late night rants.

    My thanks to Alain Halbouny, Jade Tabbara, Karl Atallah, Serge Rubeiz, and Shady Tawil for designing the second version (V2) laser-thermal thruster. Thank you to Meisam Aghajani, Mathieu Beauchesne, Ramnarine Harihar (Harry), and Andy Hofmann, the machinists who built it. Without V2, we would not have the experimental insights we have today.

    Thank you Thariq Meulendijks for the needle valve $A^*$ calibration and for help with bubble meter experiments.

    This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canada Graduate Scholarships — Master’s (CGS-M) program and the McGill Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program.
