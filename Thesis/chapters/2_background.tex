\chapter{Background} \label{chp:background}

    In recent years, the commercialization of space has greatly captured the public's imagination. Access to low Earth orbit has been made much cheaper by private companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Firefly. To access objectives deeper in space, including rapid transit of humans to Mars, the development of novel propulsion technologies is necessary. The concept of laser-thermal propulsion (LTP) was first suggested by Kantrowitz [1] and continues to be of interest [2]. This method of propulsion uses a ground- or space-based laser to heat a gas on a spacecraft, which is then expelled out of a nozzle to generate the required thrust. This propulsion method promises to be an order of magnitude more efficient than our current rocket engines. Most studies have used CO2 lasers with a wavelength of 10.6 μm [3] - [6]. However, these concepts were limited by a short focusing range due to their long laser wavelength. High power fiber lasers emitting near 1 μm (thus, having longer range) have recently become readily available, making laser propulsion more feasible than ever [7].

        The original contribution of this work 


        % Higgins text from email to Mark Wolverton: Laser thermal propulsion originated with Arthur Kantrowitz, who was involved in developing the first gas dynamic lasers that would be able to reach MW-class power in the 1960s. (Interesting connection to Jordin Kare: Jordin was also a filk-singer, which is a science-fiction themed version of folk singing. He actually wrote a song about laser thermal propulsion called “Kantrowitz 1972”. Put your coffee cup down before listening to this…) 
        %The laser-thermal rocket kind of died with the demise of high-power laser weapon research in the early 1990s. Now with Phil Lubin’s work, I think it is worthwhile looking at again. Even with a gigawatt-class laser, laser propulsion is not well suited for ground-to-orbit launch vehicles, unless they are very small (this is what Jordin’s filk song is about—rapid turn around of launching many microlaunchers using a laser).  Here’s the clip of Elon Musk making the same point: https://youtu.be/viRylmoFAj0?si=MzzsBkhHF71FLCRG
        
        %However, with Philip Lubin’s demonstration that phased array lasers can be made arbitrarily large, we can now reach much deeper into space and perform propulsive maneuvers more leisurely (say, over hours), so the power requirements now drop to the 100s of MW (rather than 10s of gigawatts!). This was the basis of our 45-days-to-Mars study, which I think you have already seen. Here is an un-paywalled version of it: [2201.00244] Design of a rapid transit to Mars mission using laser-thermal propulsion (arxiv.org)

        %The other approach is to provide laser power onto a solar panel (although one tuned to the laser wavelength) that then powers electric propulsion like an ion engine or Hall effect thruster: Laser-electric propulsion. Lubin’s group published a similar study to ours, trying to hit similar objectives (the usual “Mars in a month” metrics). I’ve attached their paper here: SheerinLubinEtAl_FastTransporationElectricPropulsionDirectedEnergy_ActaAstro2021
        %Their paper and ours make for a nice “compare and contrast” of the pluses and minuses of the laser-electric and laser-thermal approaches.

        \section{Objective}

            The objective of this research project is to test a lab-scale proof-of-concept LTP thruster for interplanetary space flight, using a \qty{1.07}{um} fiber laser. The main objective of the proposed research will be to measure the key performance parameters of this thruster (thrust and specific impulse notably), as well as characterize the laser-sustained plasma (LSP) heating core inside the thruster. This project will validate theoretical insights recently developed by the McGill Interstellar Flight Experimental Research Group [8], [9] and continue experimental research of this technology.
