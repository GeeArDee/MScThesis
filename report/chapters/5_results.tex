    \section{Preliminary ignition experiments} \label{sec:ignitiontest}
        Once the necessary components of the experiment were integrated, a preliminary testing campaign began to attempt to ignite LSP. The hope was to resolve any unforeseen practical issues, then quickly move on to replicating the power threshold experiments of past LSP literature~\cite{zimakovInteractionNearIRLaser2016,matsuiGeneratingConditionsArgon2019,luCharacteristicDiagnosticsLaserStabilized2022}. The test campaign aimed to answer two questions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can LSP be achieved with this experimental setup at all?
            \item How reliable is LSP ignition with this system?
        \end{itemize}
        To answer this, experimental trials would be run in conditions most favorable to steady LSP formation, i.e. at maximum laser power and maximum test section pressure: \qty{3}{kW} and \qty{20}{bar}. Successful ignition would be determined based on two independent measures:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The high-speed camera should be able to image the LSP growing and propagating towards the laser source over the course of the laser pulse, as consistently documented in LSP literature.
            \item A measurable drop in laser energy reaching the Gentec power meter should be observed.
        \end{enumerate}
        LSP would only be deemed to have successfully ignited if the expected behavior was observed with both instruments.

        \subsection{Spark-ignition}
            Laser alignment was immediately found to be a non-trivial problem. In order to successfully ignite the LSP, the laser must be focused onto the arc generated by the spark igniter. To maximize the chance of ignition, the laser flux at the arc must be as high as possible, so the focused laser dot must be as small as possible. This makes alignment tolerances much stricter, as the laser is less likely to be incident on the thin arc at all.

            Compounding this issue was the fact that the path taken by the arc between both electrode tips was not consistent. As seen in \autoref{fig:sparkAlignment}, the location of the arc was highly variable: though an average arc path could be determined, the arc could form up to \qty{1}{mm} away. This made it impossible to ensure consistent alignment between the arc and the laser focus. This issue could be alleviated by repeatedly triggering the spark, but the smart coil had a nominal delay of \qty{3}{ms} between sparks, only allowing up to three ignition attempts within a single laser pulses, making this approach of little viability for high-power pulse laser tests. Repeated sparks could be used with CW laser operation at \qty{300}{W}, but the lower laser power also reduces the likelihood of successful LSP ignition.

            \begin{figure}[h]

                \label{fig:sparkAlignment}
            \end{figure}

            In addition, the laser could not be aligned without placing reflecting or scattering material in the beam path. As seen in \autoref{fig:sparkAlignment}, a target must be placed near the ignition point to perform the alignment (and also serves as a scale indicator). However, this alignment target had to be removed to pressurize the test section, which was required both to determine the spark location, and to perform the LSP ignition test. Pressurization cycles and the placing/removal of this target made the alignment process slow and cumbersome. Alignment with the arcs could not be confirmed visually since the target could not be present when pressurizing the test section.

            Despite these difficulties, several attempts were made to ignite LSP with this method, and a few were successful. The first successful test was performed at \qty{10.02}{bar} with a full power pulse (\qty{30.8}{J}). A paper target had been placed next to the electrodes to facilitate alignment, so no measurements were made of the pulse energy transmitted through the plasma for the first few successful tests. However, high-speed footage showed strong evidence of plasma formation: a bright flash saturating the camera sensor, igniting at the time of spark formation, as seen in \autoref{fig:lsp1}. Such a flash had never been observed in past (failed) ignition tests. Though this suggested that some plasma had been formed, there was a possibility that the alignment target was affecting the experiment and may even have contributed to the ignition. The footage showed evidence of particles being ejected from the area around the ignition point, possibly due to the interaction between the laser, plasma, and the paper target.

            \end{figure}

            The experiment was repeated with the target several times, ensuring that the flash was not the result of merely burning a hole through the paper target. In addition, the exposure settings were adjusted (increasing the ND filter to ND2048 and setting the aperture to \textit{f}/22) to provide a clearer view of the brightest part of the frame, the LSP core. A snapshot of the resulting footage is shown in \autoref{fig:lsp3}, revealing a slender plasma core, approximately contained within the focused laser beam (note the thinner right tip of the LSP compared to the left tip). The plasma was observed to grow towards the source of the laser, as reported in experimental LSP literature. This appearance and growth behavior provided additional evidence that these tests were truly achieving laser-sustained plasma, as opposed to some other phenomenon.

            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[]{assets/3 design/LSP3_annotated.jpg}

                \label{fig:lsp3}
            \end{figure}

            To provide complete confidence that this indeed was LSP, more experiments were performed without the paper target. This allowed the measurement of the laser energy not absorbed by the plasma, and would confirm that the LSP is ignited purely by the spark, as opposed to ablated material from the paper target. With a fully uninterrupted beam path, the power meter reported a 70 to 80~\% drop in laser pulse energy during a test, suggesting that significant laser absorption was occuring in the plasma. This thus satisfied the second criterion for determining successful LSP ignition.

        \subsection{Wire-ignition}
            As power-threshold experiments were underway, as discussed in \autoref{sec:results_powerthreshold}, it became apparent that the reliability of spark-ignition was unsatisfactory. The inability to consistently arc through the laser beam meant that most ignition attempts would fail, especially below full laser power. Reliability of the spark ignition system was estimated between 10~\% and 50~\% depending on conditions.

            Private communications with Prof. Todd and Dr. Nassar (involved in \cite{akarapuNumericalModelLasersustained2009,nassarInvestigationLasersustainedPlasma2012}) highlighted the difficulty of spark ignition, and motivated the change to a solid-target system, with the use of thin metallic wire as an ignition target. Tungsten had been used successfully in past LSP experiments, such as those of \textcite{toyodaThrustPerformanceCW2002}, so \qty{0.254}{mm} (0.01") Tungsten wire was acquired and placed in the beam path as a target.

            Wire-ignition proved to be easier to work with, as laser alignment was simpler. However, it did not guarantee ignition either---wire ignition's greater reliability revealed other important factors in consistently achieving LSP:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Axial positioning of the laser focus such that it coincides with the target is crucial to generate the ``seed'' cloud of electrons necessary for LSP ignition.
                \item Ensuring high Argon purity in the chamber was also found to be important. Venting of residual air in the system done by performing several pressurization-vent cycles with Argon---at least 3 cycles up to \qty{5}{bar}---before final pressurization to the test pressure. While this was sufficient for tests at \qty{10}{bar} and above, additional cycles were found to improve ignition reliability at low pressures (\qtyrange{3}{10}{bar}).
            \end{itemize}
            Factors that were hypothesized to impact reliability but ultimately were found to have little to no impact include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Focusing the laser on the same spot on a wire across several tests
                \item Touching/dirtying the wire before installing it in the test section
                \item Sanding/cleaning the wire before installing it in the test section
            \end{itemize}
            Once these reliability factors were identified and controlled, wire ignition proved to be highly reliable, attaining practically 100~\% reliability.

        \subsection{Early LSP observations}
            These early ignition tests already allowed the observation of LSP. \autoref{fig:ignition_frames} depicts the initial growth of LSP ignited off a Tungsten wire, showing rapid growth over a fraction of a millisecond. Under the right ignition conditions, plasma would form practically as soon as the laser was turned on, before the Tungsten wire had time to heat up and melt off. This quick ignition would prove to be a useful property when combined with stepped-pulse profiles in later power threshold experiments.

            \input{assets/5 results/ignitionFrames/igntionFrames.tex}

            Selected frames of an entire LSP lifetime are shown in \autoref{fig:growth_frames}. The initially rapid LSP growth ($\sim$\qty{9}{m.s^{-1}}) slows down as it approaches steady conditions, with the front speed decreasing to less than \qty{1}{m.s^{-1}} by the end of the laser pulse. Steady-state conditions have thus not been truly achieved with full-power, \qty{10}{ms} pulses. The LSP responded practically instantaneously to the end of the laser pulse, as it dissipated from the the high speed footage in the span of 1--2 frames.

    \section{Power threshold} \label{sec:results_powerthreshold}
        Once LSP ignition had been confirmed, work began on reproducing power threshold experiments, a frequent topic in LSP research. The aim of this experiment is to determine the minimum laser power required to sustain a steady plasma, at a given pressure. Knowing this power threshold is useful to establish the operation bounds of an LSP facility, whether it is a laboratory experiment or a laser-thermal thruster. Several of such experiments have been performed for Argon with fiber-lasers: the work of \textcite{zimakovInteractionNearIRLaser2016, matsuiGeneratingConditionsArgon2019,luCharacteristicDiagnosticsLaserStabilized2022} will thus be used for comparison.
        
        \subsection{Methodology}
            The test section would be pressurized with Argon to a desired pressure between 3 and 20~bar. Then, determining the power threshold was done through a process akin to a binary search or bisection root-finding algorithm in computer science: LSP would be ignited first at the maximum setpoint power to confirm that the laser and igniter were aligned such that LSP was achievable. Power would then be reduced to a point far below the threshold (10~\% power) to confirm that LSP was not achieved. This brackets the threshold point. Subsequent tests would be performed at a power setpoint in the middle of this iteratively shrinking bracket, until the threshold was determined to be within approximately \qty{50}{W} below the last successful LSP test.

            This series of tests were performed with both spark and wire ignition. One issue encountered with wire ignition was that while lower laser powers could theoretically sustain LSP, they would not necessarily be sufficient to ignite it. To circumvent this issue, stepped laser pulse profiles were used instead of constant laser power. An example of such a pulse is shown in \autoref{fig:pulse_stepProfile}: the pulse begins at 100~\% setpoint power for \qty{0.5}{ms} to initiate the LSP off of the Tungsten wire. The power would then be stepped down to the desired power level, which would be maintained for as long as possible to ensure that the LSP could re-adjust to steady conditions.

            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[]{assets/5 results/pulse_profile}
                \caption{Typical stepped-pulse profile: \texttt{05L33\_15}}
                \label{fig:pulse_stepProfile}
            \end{figure}

            Whether LSP could be considered steady for a given test was determined by observing its behavior in the high-speed footage. It needed to fulfill two conditions:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The LSP is still visible at the end of the laser pulse
                \item The LSP is not visibly changing by the time the laser pulse ended, i.e., it is not shrinking or dimming significantly.
            \end{enumerate}
            As plasma brightness changed with laser power, the variable ND filter would be adjusted to determine whether a vanishing plasma was unstable or simply too dim to be picked up through the lens filters.

        \subsection{Results}
            The resulting power threshold plot can be seen in \autoref{fig:powerthreshold}. Both spark and wire ignition experiments are shown, along with data reported by \textcite{zimakovInteractionNearIRLaser2016,matsuiGeneratingConditionsArgon2019,luCharacteristicDiagnosticsLaserStabilized2022}. The use of wire ignition shows a significant improvement in the minimum power required to sustain LSP over the spark ignition method. The improved reliability and ease of alignment afforded by wire ignition enabled sustaining LSP down to hundreds of Watts, whereas spark ignition struggled to ignite and sustain LSP below \qty{1}{kW}. Note that the uncertainties indicated on the wire ignition data reflect the possible range in which the true power threshold lies, and is not related to an uncertainty in the power measurement.
            
            Qualitative observations were made on the LSP's response to the step-down in laser power. As seen in \autoref{fig:lsp_stepdown}, the decrease in input power is immediately apparent, with the plasma shrinking and dimming as soon as the power is dropped. The LSP re-adjusts to new power conditions in less than a millisecond. In this particular case, the LSP remained stable until the end of the laser pulse, \qty{14.8}{ms} after the step-down in power.

            \textcite{zimakovInteractionNearIRLaser2016} presented a model based on balancing input power with heat conduction ($P_\mathrm{h}$) and radiative losses ($P_\mathrm{r}$), to evaluate the power threshold as a function of pressure $P_\mathrm{t}(p)$. This expression is reproduced here as \autoref{eq:zimakov_threshold}:
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:zimakov_threshold}
                P_\mathrm{t}(p) = \frac{P_\mathrm{h}}{p^2} + P_\mathrm{r}
            \end{equation}
            \citeauthor{zimakovInteractionNearIRLaser2016}'s experiments had experimentally estimated the parameters of this equation for Argon as $P_\mathrm{h} =$~\qty{26}{bar^2.kW} and $P_\mathrm{r} =$~\qty{240}{W}. This same model was fitted to this study's wire-ignited LSP data, yielding the following power threshold parameters: $P_\mathrm{h} =$~\qty{11}{bar^2.kW} and $P_\mathrm{r} =$~\qty{178}{W}. These values can interpreted, respectively, as the minimum laser power to sustain LSP at \qty{1}{bar}, and the limiting laser power under which no LSP can be sustained even at high pressures.

            The discrepancy in the power thresholds achieved across different experiments is due in part to the optical quality of the focused beam, as suggested by \textcite{luCharacteristicDiagnosticsLaserStabilized2022}, who have so far achieved the best power-threshold results for fiber-laser-sustained Argon plasma. As the literature data is all from spark-ignited experiments, direct comparisons to wire ignition tests may be limited. However, this suggests that a low power threshold can be readily achieved by a basic optical train and a simple wire-ignition system combined with stepped pulse profiles, competing with methodologies that require far greater precision and optical quality.

    \section{Spectroscopic temperature measurement} \label{sec:results_spectroscopy}
        Spectral data was acquired for several LSP tests, at \qty{20}{bar} and \qty{10}{bar} and varying laser power settings. No collimator was mounted to the fiber termination, allowing the spectrometer to sample a relatively large field of view of the experiment, rather than a single point on the plasma. The sampling area was determined to be approximately \qty{4}{cm} in diameter at the location of the LSP. This simplified alignment procedures as some part of the LSP's emission was practically guaranteed to be captured by the fiber, and it was assumed that the emitted radiation from the hottest part of the plasma would dominate over that of cooler regions.

        \autoref{fig:spectrum_lines} shows the captured spectral data from an LSP at \qty{20}{bar} and \qty{3}{kW} of laser power. Ar~I emission lines are clearly visible and closely match the lines tabulated by NIST~\cite{kramidaNISTAtomicSpectra2022}. Continuum radiation and Ar~II emission lines are also seen in the \qtyrange{400}{600}{nm} region, exhibiting the same features seen in spectra captured by \textcite{luCharacteristicDiagnosticsLaserStabilized2022}. However, unlike \citeauthor{luCharacteristicDiagnosticsLaserStabilized2022}'s data, the captured spectrum shows a drastic difference between the intensity of continuum radiation compared to the Ar~I line emissions, almost by an order of magnitude.

        \subsection{Boltzmann plot method}
            Temperature calculation can be performed from spectral data using the Boltzmann plot method, summarized by \textcite{ohnoValidityElectronTemperature2006} and discussed in further detail by \textcite{griemSpectroscopicTemperatureMeasurements1997}. The transition of an electron from an upper atomic energy level $k$ to a lower level $i$  generates an emission line at wavelength $\lambda_{ki}$ with transition probability $A_{ki}$ and degeneracy for level $k$ of $g_k$. The following equation can be derived to relate these parameters to plasma temperature $T$:
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:transition_energy}
                \frac{\epsilon_{ki}\lambda_{ki}}{A_{ki}g_k} = \frac{\hbar cn}{2 \mathcal{Z}(T)}\exp{\left(-\frac{E_k}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)}
            \end{equation}
            Where $c$ is the speed of light, $n$ is the atomic number density, and $\mathcal{Z}(T)$ is the partition function. $\epsilon_{ki}$ is the spectrally integrated emission line intensity. This equation can be linearized with respect to $E_k$ by taking the natural log of both sides:
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:boltzmannplot}
                \ln{\frac{\epsilon_{ki}\lambda_{ki}}{A_{ki}g_k}} = -\frac{E_k}{k_\mathrm{B}T} + \ln{\frac{\hbar cn}{2 \mathcal{Z}(T)}}
            \end{equation}
            The second term is a constant for a given temperature, so $E_k$ can be plotted against the left-hand side of \autoref{eq:boltzmannplot}, resulting (in theory) in a straight line with gradient $-1/k_\mathrm{B}T$. This can then be used to evaluate $T$. However, as noted by \textcite{volkerImportancePhysicalUnits2022}, $\epsilon_{ki}\lambda_{ki}/A_{ki}g_k$ is not dimensionless, and a measure of absolute emission intensity can only be done with appropriate spectrometer calibration, which was not done in this study. There are several methods to resolve these issues, including one that can be used with the relative spectrometry data of this project: This ratio can be normalized by using a reference transition, denoted with the subscript $r$:
            \begin{equation} \label{eq:reference_transition}
                \left[\frac{\epsilon_{ki}\lambda_{ki}}{A_{ki}g_k}\right]_r = \frac{\hbar cn_r}{2 \mathcal{Z}_r(T)}\exp{\left(-\frac{E_k}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)_r}
            \end{equation}
            Multiplying either side of the original equation by the reciprocal of the above, then linearizing, yields the following, with the constant term bundled as $C$:
            \begin{equation}
                \ln{\left(\frac{\epsilon_{ki}\lambda_{ki}}{A_{ki}g_k}\left[\frac{A_{ki}g_k}{\epsilon_{ki}\lambda_{ki}}\right]_r\right)} = \frac{-E_k+[E_k]_r}{k_\mathrm{B}T} + C
            \end{equation}
            This normalization enables a temperature to be determined using relative spectral data, as they are all compared to the same reference line in the spectrum. This manipulation has no effect on the gradient of the plot.

        \subsection{Temperature calculation}
            The acquired spectral data for LSP was processed to extract temperature data using the Boltzmann plot method discussed in the previous section. A subset of emission lines strong enough to be consistently observed for all tests, and well separated from other lines to facilitate identification and spectral integration were selected for this analysis. Relevant properties for these transitions were acquired from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database~\cite{kramidaNISTAtomicSpectra2022}, and are tabulated for the selected lines in \autoref{tab:ArI_transitions}. The emission coefficients $\epsilon_{ki}$ were computed by fitting a Voigt line profile to the measured spectral lines, and integration was performed on the fitted curve. The \qty{763.51}{nm} transition was used as the reference line.

            A sample Boltzmann plot generated from LSP with \qty{20.14}{bar} Argon at \qty{3.08}{kW} is shown in \autoref{fig:boltzmannplot}. It is immediately apparent that the data points are very loosely correlated, providing low confidence in the resulting temperature, which was calculated to be \qty{8000}{K}. This does not appear possible, as ionization calculations such as the ones done in \autoref{sec:models_absorption} suggest Argon is not in a plasma state at these temperatures, and that little to no free electrons are available to absorb radiation via inverse bremsstrahlung. Furthermore, the selection of a different set of transition lines result in major variations in the computed temperature, sometimes suggesting negative absolute temperatures (characterized by a positive slope on the plot).

            There may be several reasons for this poor accuracy. The first is that the upper energy levels $E_k$ of most Ar I emission lines are clustered near \qty{13.25}{eV}, providing a poor sampling range for a linear regression. This is often the case when considering the relative line intensities only for a given atom or ion, as pointed out by \textcite{griemSpectroscopicTemperatureMeasurements1997}: excitation energies are often clustered together. This could be improved in two ways: the \qty{750.39}{nm} transition of Ar I has an excitation energy of \qty{14.95}{eV}, significantly greater than the other transitions. However, its closeness to the \qty{751.47}{nm} transition requires more sophisticated processing to discriminate its emission contribution from that of its neighboring line. Alternatively, a line emission of Ar I could be compared to an Ar II line. This however requires knowledge of electron density, and a measure of Ar II emission lines. These lines are present in the experimental data, in the \qtyrange{400}{500}{nm}, but are much fainter than the Ar I lines, far more clustered together, and blended into the continuum radiation of the plasma, making detection and integration difficult.

            Another possible factor for poor temperature results is that the spectrometer fiber sampled a relatively large area in the test section, and that contrary to the assumption made before this experiment, the emitted radiation of the hottest parts of the LSP do not dominate over colder areas, at least not for the emission lines.  \textcite{nassarInvestigationLasersustainedPlasma2012} used a collimator to sample the spectrum from specific points in the plasma and had better success in determining temperature.
