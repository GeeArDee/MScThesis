    The following chapter will explain the methodology and the results of the various experiments undertaken to validate and characterise the V2 thruster.

    \section{Static LSP validation}

        \subsection{V1 LSP spark initiation}

            For spark initiation to work reliably, the laser focus and the spark must both be aligned in space and in time.

            % Align in space
            To resolve the spark in the y and z planes (radially) \todo{define this}, the Photron SA5 camera without lens filters was placed in front of the V1 test section, looking in axially. This would be the point of view of the laser beam had it been installed. 

            \begin{figure}[!ht]

            \end{figure}
            
            Using the thickness of the electrode as a reference, the spark gap is XX mm and the spark is X mm thick. \todo{measure distance with thickness of electrode}
            The spark is \todo{measure this too} X mm thick.
            
            % Link between the two
            As the spark was recorded by the high speed camera, timing data was also collected for the spark.
            
            % Align in time
            To align the laser focus to the spark in time, the infrared laser being invisible to the camera, the beam was focused on one of the electrodes at low power. This caused the steel to glow white-hot when the laser was on. The following timings were determined by this investigation: \todo{reword this}

            \begin{figure}
                \centering

            \end{figure}

        \subsection{V2 LSP spark initiation and QCW LSP}

            % Methodology

            As timing of the spark and laser focus was kept the same as the previous section (ref), only the methodology of spatial alignement will be covered here.

            % Methodology of V2 spark initiation: moving the test section back and forth on the rail gave a reliable way to align spatially . Then 2 figures: wide fov and tight fov, stills from the alignment video I took on the power meter

            The power meter was used as a screen to align the laser focus. By moving the V2 test section back and forth on the thrust stand rail, the field of view (FOV) of the shadows projected on the power meter can be modified. 
            
            \missingfigure{2 FOVs of laser light on powermeter}

            The laser can then be moved so that the area where the visible alignment laser is brightest matches the center of the electrodes' shadow. 
            % Discussion: could do this when V2 is open (without putting flat back plate and before pressurizing) however, electrodes move a bit (approx 1mm) when pressurized so alignement is not perfect. Also, if alignement is not satisfactory the first time, the test section must be depressurized and the backplate taken off. The laser is realigned, back plate sealed back on (8 M2 screws to tighten) and test section must be purged again. THIS TAKES TOO LONG! It is easier to align with a rear window (final static LSP configuration), as the test section can be pressurized while the laser is being aligned, and the alignment can be changed without taking the window mount off.

            

            % Stills of first High-speed LSP video, showing expansion of LSP wave like in V1

            As these are at an angle and we are looking at the reflection of the LSP, no LSP velocity measurements can be made.

            With the Photron SA5 looking into the thruster from the front, LSP initiation was confirmed in V2. \todo{complete V2 initiation section, add photos, remove one of these 2 sentences}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]

            \todo{placeholder picture}



        \subsection{V2 CW LSP}

            A \qty{100}{\%} power CW shot was then attempted at \qty{20}{bar} argon. 

            [photo of laser on, Spark/LSP initiation, LSP constant, laser off (LSP dying down)]

            First the laser is turned on. A flash marks the spark initiation and instant LSP initiation. The CW LSP was kept running for about a second before the laser turns off and the LSP dies down.

            Observation of the high speed camera footage, recorded at 10000 frames per second showed the CW LSP starting at frame 32 \qty{3.2}{ms} and ending at frame 883 \qty{88.3}{ms}, lasting \qty{85.1}{ms}. This represents a 1.7 times longer lifetime than the maximum QCW pulse length of \qty{50}{ms} at this power.

            % Discussion: while these results are encouraging, more experiments with CW laser operation must be completed to determine if lifetimes can be extended an order of magnitude more, i.e. around one second.

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/4 experiments/CW pressure rise.png}
                \caption{Pressure rise with PCB transducer}
            \end{figure}

            This graph shows the pressure rise recorded by the PCB transducer connected to the oscilloscope. This was the first CW LSP generated in the lab. \todo{make better graph} Minimal damage to the window was noticed after this test, suggesting that the LSP absorbed a portion of the laser energy.

        \subsection{CW power measurement}

            Wanted to see where exactly the pulsed power threshold was. For this, needed a max CW power measurement to compare against. 
    
            Tried to measure max CW power through two lenses, without the V2 apparatus. The two lenses were rated for this flux, but the 500 mm focal length lens shattered after about \qty{50}{s} of CW lasing. The leading hypothesis is that as the lens' temperature increased, it expanded, shattering it
    
            [graph of laser power that broke lens]
    
            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{assets/4 experiments/Shattered 500 mm lens.jpg}
                \caption{Shattered \qty{500}{mm} focal length lens}
            \end{figure}
    
            This test showed a \qty{316}{W} (?) max CW power.
    
            Therefore, future CW tests will have to stay under this maximum time period, unless a lens cooling system is implemented. This could be as simple as a fan blowing cool air onto the lens.

    \section{Cold flow thruster characterisation}

        \subsection{Cold flow thrust tests}

            Cold flow tests (laser off) were completed to give a baseline measurement of thrust before eventual hot fire tests (laser on), and to validate the functioning of all data acquisition systems. Refer to appendix for Omega pressure sensor calibration \todo{Add pressure sensor calibration in appendix}.

            For thrust tests, pressure and thrust were recorded. \autoref{fig:20bar cold flow} shows a typical thrust and pressure curve for a chamber pressure of \qty{20}{bar}. Note that the thrust measurement does not return to the same value it was at initially.

            \begin{figure}[!ht]

            % TO-DO:
            \missingfigure{cold flow thrust vs pressure relation graph needs Siera's 35 points}

            Next, cold flow thrust tests were completed at chamber pressures from \qtyrange{5}{35}{bar}. 5 were done for each nominal pressure in steps of \qty{5}{bar}, for a total of 35 tests. A linear curve fit of the experimental results is presented in \autoref{fig:coldflow pressure-thrust}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]

            \end{figure}

            The empirical relation of thrust versus pressure is given by... \todo{insert relation here}.

        \subsection{Thruster nozzle effective sonic area $A^*$}

            To characterise the effective sonic area, $A^*$, of the thruster nozzle, a choked orifice blow-down test was undertaken based upon the theory in \textcite{saadCompressibleFluidFlow}. V2 in flowing configuration was pressurized to \qty{20}{bar} of argon. The argon flow was then closed. The pressure curve was recorded by the Omega \todo{part number} transducer.
            
            \missingfigure{blowdown pressure curve}

            \todo{In discussion, talk about the issue of nozzle A* being smaller with 5 papers from June 4th on slack.}

            The internal volume of the V2 thruster in flowing configuration was determined by weighing it before and after it was filled with isopropyl alcohol. Using a density of \qty{785.09}{kg/m^3}, the volume was found to be \qty{9.68e-6}{m^3}, or \qty{9.68}{ml}.

            The following expression for the pressure-time history \todo{change this wording} of a choked orifice flow was then implemented in Python. As the time scale is short (less than 10 seconds), the process is considered adiabatic and the isentropic case is used:

            \begin{equation}
                t =  \frac{-2V \left[\left(\frac{p(t)}{p_i}\right)^{(1-\gamma) / 2\gamma}\right]}{(1-\gamma) R \sqrt{T} A \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{R}(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1})^{(\gamma+1) / (\gamma-1)}}}
            \end{equation}

            Where $t$ is time, $p(t)$ is the absolute pressure in the system at time $t$, $p_i$ is the initial absolute pressure in the system, $V$ is the volume of the V2 thruster and tubing after the valve, $T$ is temperature, $A$ is the area of the nozzle's throat. \todo{add volume of tubing} With this equation, the absolute pressure in bar was plotted versus time in seconds for different values of $A$, with a specific heat ratio $\gamma$ of 1.67, a temperature of \qty{300}{K}, and an R of \qty{208.13}{J/kg*K}. The experimental pressure curve was overlayed, cut to only show the decrease in pressure right after the tank is closed, which is $t=0$.

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{assets/4 experiments/Saad blowdown fit.pdf}
                \caption{Saad blowdown model and experimental data}
            \end{figure}

            The best match was found to be an area of \qty{3.46e-8}{m^2}, giving a diameter of \qty{0.21}{mm}.

        \subsection{Needle valve effective sonic area $A^*$}

            The WL14H-320P needle valve (see \autoref{fig:Needle valve}) was calibrated to relate its rotation increments to its flow rate. This was undertaken by connecting the valve's input to a gas supply, while the valve's output was connected to a bubble flow meter constructed for this experiment (\autoref{fig:bubble meter}). The bubble flow meter and experiment methodology were presented in \textcite{barigouFluidMechanicsSoap1993}.

            Creating a uniform bubble at the base of the tube, the bubble rises upwards towards the top of the tube as it is displaced by the pressurizing gas. This end of the tube is open to the atmosphere. A stopwatch is started when the bubble passes the base of the green tape line and stopped once the bubble passes the base of the red tape line. These stopwatch measurements are repeated three times and averaged. This enables precise measurement of the volumetric flow rate.

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/4 experiments/Bubble meter.png}
                \caption{Bubble meter setup}
                \label{fig:bubble meter}
            \end{figure}

            First, the valve was calibrated with air at \qtylist{3.45;6.89}{bar}. The valve was then calibrated with \qtylist{20;50}{bar} of argon. The volumetric flow rate was measured in both cases for increments of 0.50 rotations to 2.0 rotations.

            The mass flow rate can then be derived by 

            The following calibration results and calculations were taken from \autoref{chp:app Thariq}.

            \missingfigure{sample of Thariq's table}

            Supposing that the temperature inside V2 during CW LSP thrust tests is \qty{1200}{K} and ... [Other suppositions], \autoref{chp:app Thariq} recommends a rotation increment of approximately 1.33 to produce an $A^*$ of \qty{0.147}{mm^2}.

            The following table presents a summary of the results determined from cold flow thruster characterisation.
