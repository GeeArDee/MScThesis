  abstract = {The effects of elevated gas‐flow speed were studied for the cw CO2 laser‐sustained argon plasma in a chamber of 1‐atm pressure using the argon emission spectrum. Electron temperature distribution was obtained from the 415.8‐nm Ari line‐to‐continuum intensity ratio. This temperature distribution was further utilized to calculate the fraction of laser power absorbed by the plasma, and the amount of radiation loss from the plasma. The experiments were performed for laser powers of 2.5 and 5 kW with an f/7 lens focusing scheme, and gas‐flow speeds of 2–10 m/s. The results show that as high as 86\% of incident laser energy can be absorbed by the plasma. Accounting for the plasma radiation loss, 41\%–62\% of the laser energy can still be retained as the gas thermal energy, which is a significant increase over the previously reported results for lower flow speed and smaller focusing f number.},

The apparatus was powered by a 3-kW 1070-nm fiber-optic laser and was operated with argon gas. The laser absorption, radiated spectrum, and change in static pressure were recorded, and high-speed video footage of the LSP was acquired. Of special interest is the heat-deposition efficiency into the working gas resulting from LSP ignition, which was estimated by tracking the pressure change in the test section. Laser transmission through the plasma was also measured to quantify two energy loss mechanisms: incomplete laser absorption and radiation of heat to the walls of the test section. Minimizing these losses would be critical in the realization of a practical and efficient laser-thermal propulsion (LTP) thruster, as most of the laser energy should be deposited as heat in the propellant to maximize thruster specific impulse.},

  abstract = {The application of directed energy to spacecraft mission design is explored using rapid transit to Mars as the design objective. An Earth-based laser array of unprecedented size (10~m diameter) and power (100~MW) is assumed to be enabled by ongoing developments in photonic laser technology. A phased-array laser of this size and incorporating atmospheric compensation would be able to deliver laser power to spacecraft in cislunar space, where the incident laser is focused into a hydrogen heating chamber via an inflatable reflector. The hydrogen propellant is then exhausted through a nozzle to realize specific impulses of 3000 s. The architecture is shown to be immediately reusable via a burn-back maneuver to return the propulsion unit while still within range of the Earth-based laser. The ability to tolerate much greater laser fluxes enables realizing the combination of high thrust and high specific impulse, making this approach favorable in comparison to laser-electric propulsion and occupying a parameter space similar to gas-core nuclear thermal rockets (without the requisite reactor). The heating chamber and its associated regenerative cooling and propellant handling systems are crucial elements of the design that receive special attention in this study. The astrodynamics and the extreme aerocapture maneuver required at Mars arrival after a 45-day transit are also analyzed in detail. The application of laser-thermal propulsion as an enabling technology for other rapid transit missions in the solar system and beyond is discussed.},

To achieve significantly higher specific impulses, much higher propellant temperatures will be required, thus necessitating a radically different nuclear core design. One method which has been considered in the past to achieve these higher specific impulses is to use a nuclear pulse system. In this concept, a space vehicle is propelled forward by riding the series of blast waves that result from a succession of properly timed external nuclear explosions. This concept was actually tested in the 1960s under the project name Orion, using chemical rather than nuclear explosives. Another method of achieving higher specific impulses is to employ a gaseous fissioning core so as to eliminate the problem of fuel melting at extremely high temperatures. As might be expected, a number of significant design challenges exist with this concept primarily with regard to designing a feasible means of transferring heat from the gaseous fissioning core to the gaseous propellant.},

As a result, the LSP could not be generated for the methane and methane–argon gases though the emission intensity increased with the laser irradiation. In the case of methane–xenon gases, the LSP could be generated at the xenon pressure of 0.10 MPa, and the methane pressure ranged from 0.02 MPa to 0.06 MPa. The threshold power was around 850 W, which is lower than the pure xenon condition.},

  abstract = {Several gas molecules of environmental and domestic significance exhibit a strong deep-UV absorption. Therefore, a sensitive and a selective gas detector based on this unique molecular property (i.e., absorption at a specific wavelength) can be developed using deep-UV absorption spectrophotometry. UV absorption spectrometry provides a highly sensitive, reliable, self-referenced, and selective approach for gas sensing. This review article addresses the recent progress in the application of deep-UV absorption for gas sensing owing to its inherent features and tremendous potentials. Applications, advancements, and challenges related to UV emission sources, gas cells, and UV photodetectors are assessed and compared. We present the relevant theoretical aspects and challenges associated with the development of portable sensitive spectrophotometer. Finally, the applications of UV absorption spectrometry for ozone, NO2, SO2, and aromatic organic compounds during the last decades are discussed and compared. A portable UV absorption spectrophotometer can be developed by using LEDs, hollow core waveguides (HCW), and UV photodetectors (i.e., photodiodes). LED provides a portable UV emission source with low power input, low-intensity drifts, low cost, and ease of alignment. It is a quasi-chromatic UV source and covers the absorption band of molecules without optical filters for absorbance measurement of a target analyte. HCWs can be applied as a miniature gas cell for guiding UV radiation for measurement of low gas concentrations. Photodiodes, on the other hand, offer a portable UV photodetector with excellent spectral selectivity with visible rejection, minimal dark current, linearity, and resistance against UV-aging.},

Yet in those 60 years we have barely left our solar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally leaving the solar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006\% the speed of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the nearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream of human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it is not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we should choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it is within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer ("wafersats") that reach more than \$1/4c\$ and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft with masses more than \$10\textasciicircum 5\$ kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications, imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed energy propulsion.},

  abstract = {Laser-sustained plasma (LSP) is a promising method for high-pressure plasma generation that overcomes the problems of arc discharge. Then, the generating conditions of argon LSP were investigated using a kilowatt class disk, fiber and diode lasers. For the disk and fiber lasers, the threshold laser power for LSP generation was found to decrease with pressure. The minimum laser power of the disk and fiber lasers was 1.1\,kW\,at a pressure of 1.5\,MPa and 0.45\,kW\,at a pressure of 2.0\,MPa. The threshold power of the disk laser was higher than that of the fiber laser. The fiber laser might have a lower threshold because atomic line absorption occurs at 1067\,nm and 1068\,nm since both absorption coefficients achieved through the Bremsstrahlung process are almost the same. Since LSP could not be generated by a diode laser at a pressure of less than 6.5\,MPa, the generating conditions were estimated based on the product of the absorption coefficient of laser intensity. A pressure of more than 8\,MPa was found to be necessary for a laser with 1\,kW of power, and laser power of more than 109\,kW is necessary for a pressure of 0.1\,MPa.},

  abstract = {Laser propulsion is a space transportation system that uses laser beams emitted from a satellite or laser unit on board as an energy source to generate thrust. One laser propulsion uses laser-sustained plasma (LSP) as a heat source to generate thrust. Because the plasma can be sustained indirectly, there is no electrode erosion during operation. Furthermore, because the LSP is a high-temperature heat source, the specific impulse of laser propulsion is higher than that of conventional electric propulsion. In this study, thrust performance was evaluated using a laser propulsion demonstrator. As a result, a specific impulse of 105 s and a thrust efficiency of 8\% were obtained.},

As a result of thrust measurement in vacuum, the thrust coefficient increase from 1.0 to 1.6 with increasing pressure ratio of 5–400. The energy conversion efficiency reached 37\% in vacuum.},
