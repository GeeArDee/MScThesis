\chapter{Conclusion and further work}

    \section{Further work}
        As this thesis project's \emph{raison d'Ãªtre} was to lay the groundwork for experimental research on LSP and LTP at McGill, there are many opportunities for further work. A selection of such opportunities is given below.

        \paragraph{Optimization of the test section}

        \paragraph{Improved spark ignition system}

        \paragraph{Specific impulse measurement}

        \paragraph{Absorption measurements in flowing conditions}

        \paragraph{Additional spectrometry and thermal imaging}
