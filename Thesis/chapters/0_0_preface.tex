    First, I want to thank my supervisor, Professor Andrew J. Higgins, for his deep knowledge, mentorship and support throughout this journey. I also want to thank him for giving me, and the lab, the singular opportunity to pursue graduate studies on advanced space propulsion. In Canada, this is a rare topic of research indeed, but it is only with advances in this field that humanity will be able to reach the stars.

    I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the members of the McGill Interstellar Flight Experimental Research Group. Emmanuel and Siera, in the pursuit of science together, you have given me dear memories that will last a lifetime. I wish Siera much success in continuing the work Emmanuel and I have but started. Sebastian, thank you for your knowledge on how to do things in the lab.
    
    Thank you to my parents, who have always encouraged me in my studies. Thank you to Anna, for always listening to my late night rants.

    Finally, my thanks to Alain Halbouny, Jade Tabbara, Karl Atallah, Serge Rubeiz and Shady Tawil for designing the second version (V2) laser-thermal thruster. Without it, we would not have the experimental insights we have today.
    
    % I want to thank the other graduate students from the lab: Mathias, Dan (who were working the night shift) and Sebastian (who's not a grad student just yet, but was in many ways my mentor). They 

    This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canada Graduate Scholarships — Master’s (CGS-M) program and the McGill Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program.
