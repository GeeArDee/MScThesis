# Production build checklist
When building the report for final publication (review draft or thesis submission), make sure to address the following first:
- Replace placeholder thesis committee with actual committee (title.tex)
- Change graphicx format order to `.pdf, .png` instead of `.png, .pdf` (main.tex) and double-check all figures are correct and up-to-date
- Uncomment appendix (main.tex)
- Remove textwidth and textheight values on page i (main.tex)
