\chapter{Modelling heat capacity} \label{chp:models}
    
    This was modelled for argon and hydrogen. Argon is the current gas used in experiments, while hydrogen is projected to be used for its increased $I_{sp}$.

    \section{Equilibrium calculations} \label{sec:equilibrium calcs}
        
        First, the curve fits of the seventh order polynomials were extracted from \textcite{mcbrideNASAGlennCoefficients2002}.

        Species of interest were \ce{H}, \ce{H2}, \ce{H+}, \ce{Ar}, \ce{Ar+} and electrons \ce{e-}. Plasma temperatures of about \qty{15000}{K} enable us to treat it as singly ionized.


        The calculated $C_p$ values were then validated against values from CEA.

    \section{Test problem for heat addition}

        With these variable heat capacities, a test problem can be solved, giving a preliminary 0D model of an LTP engine.
