	abstract = {Laser Propulsion is the production of high specific impulse rocket thrust using a high power laser as a remote energy source. Specific impulses in excess of 1000 seconds are achievable because propellant temperatures are very high and low molecular weight gases can be used. This report focuses on the energy conversion mechanisms of laser-sustained plasmas in flowing argon. The status of {AFOSR} sponsored experiments to determine thermal efficiency and global absorption is detailed. An improved testing facility has allowed plasma operating conditions never before possible. The results indicate that nearly all of the input laser power can be absorbed by a plasma. Plasmas at elevated gas pressure have been tested, and preliminary results presented. Optimal operating conditions have yet to be determined for the available laser powers and gas pressures. Further experimentation at very high argon gas velocities  20 ms must be performed in order to completely characterize plasma behavior. Keywords Beamed energy propulsion, Laser plasma formation.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1604.01356},
	abstract = {In the nearly 60 years of spaceflight we have accomplished wonderful feats of exploration that have shown the incredible spirit of the human drive to explore and understand our universe. Yet in those 60 years we have barely left our solar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally leaving the solar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006\% the speed of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the nearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream of human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it is not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we should choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it is within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer ("wafersats") that reach more than \$1/4c\$ and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft with masses more than \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications, imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed energy propulsion.},

In this study fundamental study on the {LSP} oscillation was carried out since it is expected that the thruster performance will be improved by the suppression of the oscillation. A model of the plasma oscillation was proposed, and its validity was evaluated from comparison with the experimental results. According to the model, it was shown that the oscillation would be suppressed by using the lens of small focusing length. The experimental results support this idea.},
