    First, I want to thank my supervisor, Professor Andrew J. Higgins, for his deep knowledge, mentorship and support throughout this journey. He gave me and our lab the singular opportunity to pursue graduate studies on advanced space propulsion. In Canada, this is a rare topic of research indeed, but it is only with advances in this field that humanity will be able to reach the stars.

    Thank you to my family for their support and encouragement during my studies.

    I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the members of the McGill Interstellar Flight Experimental Research Group. Emmanuel and Siera, in the pursuit of science together, you have given me dear memories that will last a lifetime. I wish Siera and Anthony much success in continuing the work Emmanuel and I have but started.

    Editorial help was provided by Emmanuel Duplay, Siera Riel, John Kokkalis, Sebastian Rodriguez, and Dan-Cornelius Savu. Sebastian helped manufacture the V2 electrodes. Thank you for your knowledge on how to do things in the lab. Thariq Meulendijks did the needle valve $A^*$ calibration and led the bubble flow meter experiments.

    Alain Halbouny, Jade Tabbara, Karl Atallah, Serge Rubeiz, and Shady Tawil designed and assembled the Version 2 (V2) laser-thermal thruster, as well as produced its drawings and renders. Thank you to Meisam Aghajani, Mathieu Beauchesne, Ramnarine Harihar (Harry), and Andy Hofmann, the machinists who built V2. Without it, we would not have the experimental insights we have today.

    This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canada Graduate Scholarships â€” Master's (CGS-M) program and the McGill Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program.
