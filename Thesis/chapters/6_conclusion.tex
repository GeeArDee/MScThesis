    \section{Future Work}
        (be sure to talk about these in text before, where these would be improvements and why)
        Use a more powerful laser. Instead of 300 W CW, use 3kW CW.
        Implement spectroscopic measurements to determine temperature of plasma in our setup
        Use a rotating arm thrust stand for more repeatable measurements
        Move to hydrogen as a propellant
        Complete thrust tests in vacuum
